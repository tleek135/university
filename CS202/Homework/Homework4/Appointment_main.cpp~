 * Description: Test the functionality of the Appointment class
   and all of its derived classes.  
 * Solution: Create a vector of pointers to Appointment objects; this
   will allow you to store pointers to objects of Appointment's derived
   classes as well. Call the member functions on each object to search
   for an appointment.
