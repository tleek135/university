This is a test
of the functionality of this file.
I am attempting to insert alternating lines
from two different files into a third file.
I am using the file stream features of C++
in order to do this. 
Now these extra few lines of text are here

simply to see whether or not the program 
can copy extra lines from a longer text file.
